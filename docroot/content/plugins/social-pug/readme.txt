== Description ==
**The only social sharing plugin you need.**

Grow by Mediavine, formerly Social Pug is an easy, all-in-one social sharing plugin. You can add social share buttons that integrate beautifully with your website’s design, leading to increased engagement and reach.

The free version of this social sharing plugin allows you to customize the four biggest social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn.

For all social media platforms, you can personalize the social share buttons to your liking. Choose from a variety of designs and utilize custom colors to catch the eye. You can even include social share counts.

You can place the social sharing buttons before and after the post content, or have the social buttons follow your readers as they scroll up and down the page, in the form of a social media floating sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What social sharing buttons are supported? =

The free version of Grow supports Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn as social sharing buttons.

Pro sharing buttons include: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, VK, WhatsApp, Pocket, Yummly, Buffer, Tumbler, Xing, Flipboard, Telegram and Mix, as well as buttons for emailing and printing the article.

= Can I activate tweet count for my Twitter social sharing button? =

Twitter has officially removed support for the tweet count of a URL. Luckily a third party application named OpenShareCount provides an alternative solution. Grow has partnered with OpenShareCount to provide social sharing proof for your Twitter social sharing button.

= Can I customize the social information that is being shared on social media? =

By default, Grow will use the post’s title and featured image to populate what is being shared on social platforms. If you wish to have full control of what content is shared, we will soon be releasing our Pro version, which will include this feature.

= Will your social sharing plugin slow down my website? =

No. Grow is a lightweight plugin that was built with efficiency and pagespeed in mind. Unlike other social sharing plugins, Grow will not slow down your website.

= Do the social share buttons work on only on posts and pages? =
You are not limited to only posts and pages. Both the inline social share buttons and the floating sidebar social share buttons may be placed on any custom post type that your WordPress installation supports.
