== Description ==

**"There are several dedicated plugins that you can use. In my opinion, the best is Schema App Structured Data."**
[Neil Patel's Blog on Structured Data](http://neilpatel.com/blog/structured-data/)

**What Markup does Schema App Wordpress Plugin Create?**

By activating the plugin Schema App Wordpress plugin automatically creates [schema.org](http://schema.org/) markup for the all your pages, posts, author and category content leveraging information that already exists in your Wordpress website. Just activate the plugin, adding your logo and name of your business, BAM, your content is optimized to be fully understood by search engines resulting in higher traffic, higher click through rates and more.  The plugin also provides all three Google Site Structure features including Breadcrumbs, Sitelinks Searchbox and Your Site Name in Results.  Schema App Wordpress plugin also integrates with [Schema App Tools](https://www.schemaapp.com) to automatically deploy custom content (see below). 

**Video Feature in version 1.9** 

[Google's Powerful Video Features](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/videos) are now added automatically for all YouTube videos. 

**What type of markup is automatically created with this plugin?**

* Page : http://schema.org/Article
* Post : http://schema.org/BlogPosting
* Search : http://search.org/SearchResultsPage
* Author : http://schema.org/ProfilePage
* Category : http://schema.org/CollectionPage
* Tag : http://schema.org/CollectionPage
* Blog : http://schema.org/Blog
* BreadcrumbList : http://schema.org/BreadcrumbList
* WebSite : http://schema.org/WebSite

All of these pages get extremely detailed schema.org data based on what's possibly mapped from the database. Customization of Page and Post schema markup can be done through default settings (e.g. posts can default to NewsArticle) as well as by directly editing the generated JSON-LD for each page.
