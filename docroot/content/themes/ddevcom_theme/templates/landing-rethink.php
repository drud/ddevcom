        <p><b>Your Dev-to-Deploy Unified Toolchain -</b> DDEV-Live is a container-based PaaS hosting platform brought
          to you by the creators of the DDEV-Local local development environment. Our mission is to make your
          dev-to-deploy experience as simple and reliable as possible. We like to say, "Our stuff helps you build
          better stuff," because we get the complexity out of your way so you can do the valuable parts of your job
          without distraction. If you work with multiple CMSs, DDEV-Local runs them all with a unified set of commands
          and offers a GUI for the less-technical. DDEV-Live PaaS hosting completes the end-to-end, local-to-live
          tooling that you need when youâ€™re ready to take on containers, DevOps, or CI/CD processes.</p>
