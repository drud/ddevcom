          installation of a supported CMS (at our discretion, technical limitations apply) on DDEV-Live, up to a value
          of $150 US dollars. We’ll extend your early access a further $150 in value if you file a support ticket,
          referring a friend or colleague who signs up for our trial, or if you contribute to our DDEV open source
          tooling and/or the improvement of our platform in the form of patches, pull requests, bug reports, or feature
          requests.</p>
        <p class="small">We’ll give you a hand getting started. Ticket-based migration, onboarding assistance, and
          support included.</p>
